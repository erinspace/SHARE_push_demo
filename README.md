Demonstration of the SHARE Push API
===============

This code is an example of how a provider for content for the SHARE notification service would push content to be included in the notification stream. 

Right now, the data is accepted in the same schema output by the SHARE otification system, specified on the [main page's github wiki](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/SHARE/wiki/SHARE-schema).
